## What are these notebooks?

[IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) notebooks
are [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)/[IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/)
running Julia code. These notebooks offer a convenient and modern solution
for writing [literate documents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
that mix code, text, equations, and other multimedia elements.

## List of available notebooks

Notebooks are given names based on the first date I have used them for a demo.

Some of these will have been updated more recently.

- **The Colors of Chemistry (2014-06-09)**:
  demonstrates the relationship between UV-vis spectroscopic data and
  the human-perceived colors as described by color spaces.

- **World of Julia (2014-06-30)**:
  shows how to download data by querying the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and
  [OpenStreetMap's Nominatim](nominatim.openstreetmap.org) geocoding service, and
  render the results on a vector map.

- **Parallel Prefix (2014-08-06)**:
  explains the [parallel prefix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum)
  (a.k.a. scan or prefix sum) algorithm, specifically the Brent-Kung form,
  and how polymorphism in Julia allows the same implementation to be reused for
  formal verification, visualization, and distributed computation.
  Update: the ideas in this notebook are
  [now published](http://jiahao.github.io/parallel-prefix/).
